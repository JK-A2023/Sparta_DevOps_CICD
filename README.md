# CICD

This repository contains material about CICD.

The entire CICD process is a pipeline to help business release software faster.

## What is it?

A set of practices and automation techniques to ensure code changes are integrated, tested, and delivered to production quickly and reliably.

1. Continuous Integration
   1. Code is frequently merged into code shared repository.
   2. This code is tested automatically.
   3. If the merge is unsuccessful, you are alerted within minutes.
   4. This is done continously throughout a project, as to avoid everyone trying to merge just before completion.
2. Continuos Delivery / Deployment
   1. Delivery:
      1. Post release, you can continue to deliver new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way.
      2. Release process is automated, and project can be deployed with one button.
   2. Deployment:
      1. All changes that pass all production tests are released to customers.
      2. No human intervention.
      3. Only changes that fail tests will not be deployed.

Also recieves feedback continously, as to work these changes into production to better the product.
